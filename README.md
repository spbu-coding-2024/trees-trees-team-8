## Overview

This kotlin-library implements such trees:
- **Binary Search Tree:** A basic binary search tree without self-balancing.
- **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing tree using height-based rotations.
- **Red-Black Tree:** A self-balancing tree enforcing color properties.

Each implementation offers core operations such as `insert`, `delete`, and `search` while maintaining internal consistency and performance guarantees.
