[![CI Status](https://github.com/spbu-coding-2024/trees-trees-team-8/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spbu-coding-2024/trees-trees-team-8/actions)

## Overview

This project includes three types of sorting:
- **BST (Binary Search Tree):** A basic binary search tree without self-balancing.
- **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing tree using height-based rotations.
- **Red-Black Tree:** A self-balancing tree enforcing color properties.

Each implementation offers core operations such as `insert`, `delete`, and `search` while maintaining internal consistency and performance guarantees.
